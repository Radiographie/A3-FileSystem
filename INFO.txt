	The programs are implemented as required, but with minor missing details:
		* flags are not implemented, eg. "-a" flag in ext2_ls, instead, the program will print "." and ".." as default.
		* "-r" flag of "ext2_rm" is not implemented.
		* directories and files could have same names.
		* "rm" cannot remove directories including "." and "..".
		* "ls" cannot accept file as an argument.
